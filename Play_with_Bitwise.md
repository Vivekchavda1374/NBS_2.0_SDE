# 🔧 Bitwise Properties for Competitive Programming

This repository contains a curated list of **bitwise tricks, properties, and patterns** that are frequently used in **competitive programming**. Bit manipulation is a powerful tool for writing highly efficient code, especially in contests where both time and space are critical.

## 🚀 Why Bitwise?

Bitwise operations:
- Are extremely **fast** (constant time).
- Allow elegant solutions for problems involving subsets, masks, parity, etc.
- Help in optimizing space with **bitsets** and compact representations.

## 🔦 Finding MSB and LSB

**LSB (Least Significant Set Bit)**:
- Isolate: `n & -n`
- Clear: `n & (n - 1)`
- Position (0-based index): Count trailing zeros

**MSB (Most Significant Set Bit)**:
- Isolate: Use a method to round `n` down to the nearest power of 2.
    - Example logic:
        ```
        n |= n >> 1
        n |= n >> 2
        n |= n >> 4
        n |= n >> 8
        n |= n >> 16
        ...
        (n + 1) >> 1
        ```
- Position (0-based index): Count leading zeros in word size, subtract from total bits

## 🧮 Set Manipulation Using Bits

You can represent a subset of `{0, 1, ..., N-1}` using a single integer of `N` bits.

| Operation               | Code                      | Meaning                      |
|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Add element `i`        | `mask \|= (1 << i)`         | Add `i` to set               |
| Remove element `i`     | `mask &= ~(1 << i)`        | Remove `i` from set          |
| Toggle element `i`     | `mask ^= (1 << i)`         | Toggle presence of `i`       |
| Check element `i`      | `(mask & (1 << i)) != 0`   | Check if `i` is in set       |
| Count elements in set  | Count of 1s in binary      | Number of elements present   |

|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Loop through all subsets of a set      | `for (int sub = mask; sub; sub = (sub - 1) & mask)` |
| Get highest one bit (like log2)        | Use MSB isolation techniques                |
| Get position of rightmost set bit      | Use LSB and count trailing zeros            |
| Turn off rightmost 1-bit               | `n & (n - 1)`                               |

## 🛠 Tools & Tips

- Use built-in bit functions when available: trailing/leading zero count, population count.
- Use `bitset<N>` or equivalent for compact set representation.
- Avoid undefined behavior when shifting: only shift within type’s bit-width.
